    r = """1. Virus Total is a service that can take a URL and check it against multiple security vendors and report back if the URL may be malicious or clean! 
Remember: The API is an open-source intelligence tool so it's important you do not just use this technique by itself as it very well could tell you a link is clean but in reality, it is not!

2. The machine learning in this tool is a smart bit of code that can take a URL and predict if it can be phishing or not, it will give you a prediction score to tell you how likely it is a phishing URL.

3. The redirect label is populated when you scan a URL, it checks that there are no redirects within the link that might take you to another webpage! 
Hint: If the redirect link is very different from the URL in the email, it is likely they are directing you to a phishing website!

4. The â€˜search logsâ€™ button searches through your mail server logs for any emails that have the same sender. It can also check for anyone who has visited the URL within your business. 
Hint: This can help you find more phishing emails; if the email you are exploring is phishing and the logs show this sender has sent other emails, it is likely these emails are also phishing!

    Tips:
    - Check the grammar of the email.
    - Check the sender of the email, is it trying to pretend to be someone it isnâ€™t?
    - Is the webpage trying to redirect you?
    - Think of Web Proxy Logs as your search history, but just for every website you and anyone on your network might visit!
    - POST 200 connections on the web-proxy checks indicate a user might have entered their credentials into a site """
